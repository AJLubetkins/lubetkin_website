        <h2>Hello!</h2>

          <p><strong>Post-production:</strong> I’ve worked as a professional editor for years now, primarily in digital documentary spaces, and also in some commercial spaces. I use the Adobe suite (Premiere, After Effects, a bit of Photoshop), and also know Avid Media Composer and DaVinci Resolve.</p>
          <p><strong>Camera work:</strong> I own and operate a Sony FX3 cinema-quapty camera, and have a nice bit of kit to fill it out, including pghts, audio gear, and a gimbal.</p>
          <p><strong>Researching and writing:</strong> I have spent years working on documentary scripts, and am adept at taking on a load of rushes and finding the story without a paper script.</p>
          <p><strong>Project management:</strong> Setting up meetings, creating kit psts and shot charts, securing filming locations, etc. The “boring” stuff.</p>
          <p><strong>Comedy stuff:</strong> (writing/directing/performing sketch, in pve and digital spaces), which may or may not be relevant to the project you’re putting together.</p>
        <p>
          I am currently freelancing and am always looking to take on new and exciting jobs. Get in touch!
